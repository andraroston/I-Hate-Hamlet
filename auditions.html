			<h3><u>Character Descriptions</u><h3>
			
			<p>Andrew Rally: A soap opera actor recently relocated from LA to NYC to become a "real actor." Charming and handsome - possesses the ease of a television star. Age: late 20s or early 30s.</p>
			
			<p>John Barrymore: A real person. Witty and rakish, with a gleeful take on life and all it offers. Fully embraces his past, and is here to extol the virtues of Hamlet. Should be very over the top. Age: late 20s or older.</p>
			
			<p>Lillian Troy: Andrew's agent, in her 70's (may be played younger for our purposes.) Elegant and no-nonsense; loves a bit of fun.</p>
			
			<p>Felicia Dantine: A high energy real estate agent who can communication with the dead. A bit off the wall, but very determined. Any age.</p>
			
			<p>Deirdre McDavey: Andrew's girlfriend. A 29 year old virgin who is a wild romantic. Full of wonder and is always on the verge of a swoon - life is a miracle a minute.</p>
			
			<p>Gary Peter Lefkowitz: The "villain" of the play. Real LA actor - always looking for the next big thing. Almost puppy like, who has very little sense of reality. </p>
